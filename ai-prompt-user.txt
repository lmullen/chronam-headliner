You will be given the OCR text of a historical newspaper page from Chronicling America. The OCR quality is poor. Your task is to split it into individual articles with their respective headlines, and return the cleaned up headlines from the text. 

<ocr_text>
{{ .OCR }}
</ocr_text>

Your task consists of two main parts:

1. Identify the headlines on the page.
2. Improve the quality of the OCR text of those headlines it more readable.

To split the document into articles and headlines:
- Identify distinct articles within the text
- Locate and extract the headline for each article
- If an article doesn't have a clear headline, then you can skip it
- Ensure that the body of each article contains all relevant text, excluding the headline


To improve the OCR quality:
- Correct obvious spelling mistakes and OCR errors
- Fix punctuation and capitalization where necessary
- Reconstruct partial words or phrases that may have been cut off or misinterpreted by the OCR process
- Maintain the original meaning and content of the text as much as possible

Provide your output in valid JSON format. The correct JSON format is defined with this JSON schema:

{{ .Schema }}

Additional instructions:
- If you encounter any advertisements or non-article content, you can skip them.
- Do not make up any headlines. 

Remember to focus on improving readability and accurately splitting the content into articles while preserving the original meaning and structure of the newspaper page.
